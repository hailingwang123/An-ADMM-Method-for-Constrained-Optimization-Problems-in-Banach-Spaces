An ADMM Method for Constrained Optimization Problems in Banach Spaces
This includes two zip files. The first zip file is using the designed ADMM to address the nonlinear constrained problems posed in Banach spaces and the second file is using projected gradient method to soving the considered problems.

run main to obtain the results that obtained in our paper.

It is worth noting that for solving problem 1 Line 60-61 is the inexact solver for each nonconvex subproblem while Line 62-63 is using default optimization tool to solve each nonconvex subproblem. The read should comment 60-61 or 62-63, and the similar procedures also happen in Line 60-61 and Line 63-64 of main.m of problem 2, and Line 93-94 and Line 97-98 of main.m of problem 3.
